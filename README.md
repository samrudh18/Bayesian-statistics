# Bayesian-statistics

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of Bayesian models. The algorithms have been implemented in Python using the following libraries: Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and PyMC3. All of the above was done as a part of the CGS698C-Bayesian Models & Data Analysis course instructed by Prof Harish Karnick at IIT Kanpur (Spring-2020).   

## [Assignment - 1](/CGS689C-Assignment-2-Notebook.ipynb)  

Contains the implementation and analysis of:  

a) Bayesian Models implementation  
&emsp;	i) Analytical  
&emsp;	ii) MCMC Sampling  
&emsp;	iii) PyMC3  
b) Data  
&emsp;	i) Binomial   
&emsp;	ii) Correlation (Height-Weight)    
c) Evaluation  
&emsp;	i) Number of samples  
&emsp;	ii) Progress of Distribution (entering data points sequentially)  

## [Assignment - 2](/CGS689C-Assignment-2-Notebook.ipynb)  

The assignment contains the implementation and analysis of a Generalised Context Model (GCM) to model human data from a categorisation task conducted by John Kruschke ([Krushcke, 1993](https://jkkweb.sitehost.iu.edu/articles/Kruschke1993CS.pdf)).
